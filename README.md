# Private-Server-Monitor

Roblox Private Server Monitor is a desktop application designed to automatically monitor
a Roblox private server session and reconnect when the Roblox client closes or crashes.
The goal is simple: reduce downtime and remove the need for manual relaunching when
a private server disconnects.
This application runs locally on your computer and works by monitoring the Roblox
process and reopening your private server link when needed.
